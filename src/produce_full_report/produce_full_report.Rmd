# Introduction 

As of 23^rd^ August 2020,  more than
23,000,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported across the world, 
with more than 800,000 deaths [@whositrep]. 

This weekly report presents forecasts of the
*reported* number of deaths
in the week ahead and analysis of case reporting trends (case
ascertainment) for 69 countries with active transmission.

The accuracy of these forecasts vary with the quality of surveillance
and reporting in each country. We use the reported number of deaths due to
COVID-19 to make these short-term forecasts as these are likely more
reliable and stable over time than reported cases. In countries with
poor reporting of deaths, these forecasts will likely represent an
under-estimate while the forecasts for countries with few deaths might
be unreliable.

Note that the results presented in this report do not explicitly model
the
various interventions and control efforts put in place by countries. 
Our estimates of transmissibility reflect
the epidemiological situation at the time of the infection of COVID-19
fatalities. Therefore, the impact of controls on estimated
transmissibility will be quantifiable with a delay between
transmission and death.


For short-term forecasts in low-and-middle-income countries using 
models explicitly accounting for interventions, see
[here](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports). For similar
analyses published by the Imperial College COVID-19 response team  for
European countries
see [here](https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/). 
A detailed model for the United States of America published by 
Imperial College COVID-19 response team is available
[here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-23-united-states/).
The United States of America has therefore been excluded from the
analysis presented in this report and is not included in the results
presented in the section on North & Central America.

*Figure 1.* (A) The reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 in
Africa, Asia, Europe, North & Central America, and South America. (B) The number
of countries with active transmission (at least 100
deaths reported, and at least *ten* deaths observed in each of the past
two weeks) in Africa, Asia, Europe, North & Central America, and South America.



# Objectives and Caveats

The **main** objective in this report is to produce forecasts of the 
number of deaths in the week ahead for each country with active
transmission.

* We define a country as having active transmission if at least 100
deaths have been reported in a country so far, and 
at least *ten* deaths were observed in the country in each of the past
two weeks. For the week beginning 23^rd^ August 2020, 
the number of countries/regions included based on these thresholds is 69.

* We forecast the number of potential deaths as the reporting of deaths
is likely to be more reliable and stable over time than the reporting 
of cases. 

* As we are forecasting deaths, the latest estimates of
transmissibility reflect the epidemiological situation at the time of
the infection of COVID-19 fatalities. Therefore, the impact of
controls on estimated transmissibility will be quantifiable with a
delay between transmission and death.


A **secondary** objective of this report is to analyse case
ascertainment per country. As well as forecasting ahead, we use the number
of reported deaths and of cases reported with a delay (delay from reporting to deaths,
see Case Ascertainment method) to analyse the reporting trends per
country. If the reporting of cases and deaths were perfect, and
the delay between reporting and death is known, the ratio of
deaths to delayed cases would equal the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR).

In this analysis, key assumptions are:

* The mean underlying CFR is 1.38% (95% Credible Interval (1.23 - 1.53)) [@verity2020],
* The delay from a case being reported to death follows a gamma distribution with mean 10 days, and standard deviation 2 days.
* All deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in each country.



# Projections and Effective Reproduction Number Estimates {.nav .nav-tabs} 

## Projections

**Current and past forecasts**

*Note*: The projections and estimates of $R_t$ assume a constant
reporting of death. That is, even if deaths are not under-reported, we
assume a constant reporting rate over time. This assumption does not
always hold.

## Estimates of the current Effective Reproduction Number

### Global Summary

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/rt_phase_si_2.png")
```
*Figure 7.* Estimates of transmissibility in countries with active
transmission for the week ending 23^rd^ August 2020. A country is defined
to be in the declining phase if the 97.5^th^ quantile of the effective
reproduction number is below 1. It is defined to be in the growing
phase if the 2.5^th^ quantile of the effective reproduction number is
above 1 and the width of the 95% CrI is less than 1. 
If the 2.5^th^ quantile of the effective reproduction number is
below 1 and the width of the 95% CrI is less than 1, we define the
phase as stable/growing slowly. If the width of the 95% CrI is
more than 1, the phase is defined as uncertain.
Note that
estimates of transmissibility rely on a constant rate of reporting of
deaths. This assumption does not always hold.

# Analysis of Trends in Reporting

## Temporal trend in the ratio of deaths to reported cases 

Starting in March, we compute the average and 95% CI for the ratio of
deaths  to reported cases (with a mean 10-day delay) using a moving window
of 7 days. The ratio accounts for the delay between death and case
being reported. Any temporal trend in the ratio suggests a change in
the reporting. For instance, an increase in the ratio gives an
indication that cases reporting is decreasing. If all cases
(including asymptomatic cases) and death were reported, then the ratio defined
would be equivalent to the infection fatality ratio (IFR).

## Case Ascertainment

Case ascertainment was estimated based on the deaths in the previous 2 weeks  and 
reported cases in the 10 days prior to that period.  Estimates of case
ascertainment were highly variable and, due to the underlying
assumption of perfect reporting, are likely to be an underestimate. In
particular, community deaths due to COVID-19 are likely under-reported
[@onsreport].

(**i**) the estimated ratio of deaths to reported cases 10 days prior
for each country (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14 days*; (**ii**) the estimated
  case ascertainment per country (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14
  days*. Estimated case ascertainment, factors to real
  size and predicted true number of cases assume perfect reporting of
  deaths.

# Methods

We define a country to have active transmission if

-  at least 100 deaths have been observed in the country so far; and 
-  at least ten deaths were observed in the country in the last two
consecutive weeks. 

We intend to produce forecasts every
week, for the week ahead. Ensemble forecasts are produced from the
outputs of three different models. We assume a gamma distributed
serial interval with mean 6.48 days
and standard deviation of 3.83 days following [@ferguson2020report].


## Model 1

The approach estimates the current
reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases generated
by a typical infected individual, $R_t$) and to use that to forecast
future incidence of death. The current reproduction number is
estimated assuming constant transmissibility during a chosen
time-window (here, one week).


**Estimating current transmissibility**

Here we relied on a well-established and simple method
[@nouvellet2018simple] that assumed the daily incidence, I~t~ (here
representing deaths), could be approximated with a Poisson process
following the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating]:

$$I_t \sim Pois\left( R_t \sum_{s=0}^tI_{t-s}w_s\right)$$

where $R_t$ is the instantaneous reproduction number and $w$ is the
serial interval distribution. From this a likelihood of the data given
a set of model parameters can be calculated, as well the posterior
distribution of $R_t$ given previous observations of incidence and
knowledge of the serial interval [@cori2013new]. 


We used this approach to estimate $R_t$ over three alternative
time-windows defined by assuming a constant $R_t$ for 10 days 
prior to the most recent data-point. We made no assumptions
regarding the epidemiological situation and transmissibility prior to
each time-window. Therefore, no data prior to the time-window were
used to estimate $R_t$, and instead we jointly estimated $R_t$ as well as
back-calculated the incidence before the time-window. Specifically, we
jointly estimated the $R_t$ and the incidence level 100 days before the
time-widow. Past incidence was then calculated using the known
relationship between the serial interval, growth rate and reproduction
number. The joint posterior distribution of $R_t$ and the early
epidemic curve (from which forecasts will be generated) were inferred
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.


The model has
the advantage of being robust to changes in reporting before the
time-window used for inference.

**Forward projections**

We used the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating] to project the incidence
forward, given a back-calculated early incidence curve, an estimated
reproduction number, and the observed incidence over the calibration
period. We sampled sets of back-calculated early incidence curves
and reproduction numbers from the posterior distribution obtained in
the estimation process. For each of these sets, we simulated
stochastic realisations of the renewal equation from the end of the
calibration period leading to projected incidence trajectories. 


Projections were made on a 7-day horizon. 
The transmissibility is assumed to remain constant over this time
period. 
If transmissibility were to decrease as a result of control interventions
and/or changes in behaviour over this time period, we would predict 
fewer deaths; similarly, if transmissibility were to increase
over this time period, we would predict more deaths We
limited our projection to 7 days only as assuming constant
transmissibility over longer time horizons seemed unrealistic in light
of the different interventions implemented by different countries and
potential voluntary behaviour changes.


## Model 2

**Estimating current transmissibility**

The standard approach to inferring the effective reproduction number at
$t$, $R_t$, from an incidence curve (with cases at t denoted I~t~) is
provided by [@cori2013new]. This method assumes that
$R_t$ is constant over a window back in time of size *k* units (e.g. days
or weeks) and uses the part of the incidence curve contained in this
window to estimate $R_t$. However, estimates of $R_t$ can depend strongly on
the width of the time-window used for estimation. Thus
mis-specified time-windows can bias our inference. In [@parag2019optimising]
we use information theory to extend the approach of Cori et al. to optimise
the choice of the time-window and refine estimates of $R_t$. 
Specifically:

-   We integrate over the entire posterior distribution of $R_t$, to
    obtain the posterior predictive distribution of incidence at time
    t+1 as P(I~t+1~ \| I~1~^t^) with I~1~^t^ as the incidence curve up
    to t. For a gamma posterior distribution over $R_t$ this is analytic and negative
    binomial ([see @parag2019optimising] for exact formulae). 
	
-   We compute this distribution sequentially and causally across the
    existing incidence curve and then evaluate every observed case-count
    according to this posterior predictive distribution. For example at
    t = 5, we pick the true incidence value I~5~\* and evaluate the
    probability of seeing this value under the predictive distribution
    i.e. P(I~5~ = I~5~\* \| I~1~^4^).

This allows us to construct the accumulated predictive error (APE) under
some window length *k* and under a given generation time distribution
as:

$$\text{AP}E_{k} = \sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1}{- \log{P\left( I_{t + 1} = I_{t + 1}^{*}\  \right|\ I_{t - k + 1}^{t})\ \ }}$$

The optimal window length *k\** is then
$k^{*} = \arg{\min_{k}{\text{AP}E_{k}}}$.  Here
*T* is the last time point in the existing incidence curve.

**Forward Projections**

Forward projections are made assuming that the transmissibility
remains unchanged over the projection horizon and same as the transmissibility
in the last time-window.  The projections are made using the standard
branching process model using a Poisson offspring distribution. 


## Model 3

```{r child = "case_ascertainment_methods.Rmd"}
```

## Model 4

Model 4 is a Bayesian model that calculates backwards from the deaths
observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several
weeks prior. This model estimates the number of infections, deaths and
the changes in transmissibility due to the non-pharmaceutical
interventions for 12 European countries (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom). Details for this model and
its results can be
found [here](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19estimates/).

## Ensemble Model

For the 12 European countries where we have results from Model 4 (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom), the ensemble model is an
unweighted ensemble of Models 1, 2, 3 and 4. For all other countries,
the ensemble model is built from Models 1, 2 and 3.

The forecasts produced use the reported daily counts of deaths per
country available on the ECDC website:

*Notes* 
Some countries have been excluded from the analysis despite meeting
the threshold because the number of deaths per day did not allow
reliable inference. A complete list of corrections applied to the data downloaded
from ECDC is available
[here](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid19-forecasts-orderly/blob/main/src/prepare_ecdc_data/R/corrections_23August.R). 
All corrections are based on the numbers reported by the World Health
Organization (https://covid19.who.int) or Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info).
